      <h1>Playtesting Reports:</h1>
      <h2>Alpha Playtest &ndash;</h2>
      <p>Respondent 1:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>The graphics and the game mechanics are awesome. I think they have a great game.</li>
      	<li>An intro on how to play the game, explaining the goal of the game and the mechanics is needed.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 2:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>The graphics are awesome! the game visually is very complete.</li>
      	<li>The movements and "each turn" are a little hard to understand. Both testers in the room struggled to figure out how to operate the players.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4.5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 3:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>The idea of the game is fun.</li>
      	<li>Do not know the controls.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4.25</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 4:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Graphics and overall mechanics look good.</li>
      	<li>I'm unsure what keys I should be pressing to play the game. The goal of the game isn't clear to me. I would like if I could move my units backwards while in the moving phase to retrace my steps or if I made a mistake.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 5:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>The art is very good. The simple moving mechanics. The game is very simple and works well. I really enjoy it.</li>
      	<li>I've never played this type of game before, so it wasn't very intuitive. I didn't know the E was select or that F was to exit out of the menu. Also, I think it would be helpful if the turn ended automatically once you've moved all of your players.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 6:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Great visuals, works well.</li>
      	<li>Making it more clear what to do and how is needed.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 3.25</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 7:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Good movement, great visuals, UI.</li>
      	<li>Indicator when all units have moved would be good.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 8:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>I think the game was cool and fun to play.</li>
      	<li>Maybe it needs to relate somehow to the Space Survival theme? Overall it is a cool game! Also maybe both players should have different controllers?</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4.75</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 9:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Art design, controls, menu, UI are nice.</li>
      	<li>Instructions are needed.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 10:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Game mechanics are good.</li>
      	<li>User interface: may consider a tutorial.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 3.75</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 11:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>The game design looks very professional.</li>
      	<li>Need some sort of instructions.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4.5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 12:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Very detailed scenery and graphics and UI with information.</li>
      	<li>Controls are slightly unclear at first. There also exists a bug where, if a player dies, the next one to enter that tile cannot attack nor be selected by the other player.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4.5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 13:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>The movement mechanics are working really well, and the art already looks really amazing. I'm excited to see more mechanics and gameplay.</li>
      	<li>I personally had difficulty figuring out that I needed to press E to select things and move them. I was very confused at the start of the game.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 14:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Art style, turn based gameplay is great.</li>
      	<li>Communicating to player controls, goals need some work.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 3.75</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 15:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Art is amazing; I really like this style of game.</li>
      	<li>Controls are really confusing (had to try almost every key on keyboard to figure it out), adding more strategic aspects.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 16:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>The pixel art is very beautiful, and I like this sort of game.</li>
      	<li>There are a few bug fixes that need to be implemented and a lot more functionality.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4.25</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 17:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>The game's graphics are impressive. I also love the concept, and I love that two players can play. That's amazing.</li>
      	<li>The game is fairly complex and so there will need to be a lot of instructional material. This is not a problem regarding an alpha build of the game though.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4.5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Decisions Reached:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>The art style of the game is very successful, and we should keep in line with it.</li>
      	<li>The base game mechanics and gameplay are successful and should be built upon.</li>
      	<li>Some form of instructions for both controls and game mechanics is desperately needed.</li>
      	<li>Bug noted by respondent 12 must be fixed.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Final Demo Playtest &ndash;</h2>
      <p>Respondent 1:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>If getting the AI to work is possible by the deadline, it would be extremely fun to play.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4.2</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 2:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>The controls are kind of hard, should have a demo. Overall design is great!</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 3:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Keep going! It has high potential.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4.2</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 4:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>I like the aesthetic and the idea behind the game. I do wish it had audio, but other than that the game was fun to play and a cool idea.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4.6</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 5:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Audio missing, but that's about it. Really, really good job at capturing the advance wars aesthetic.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4.8</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 6:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Add some audio, undo options, and include information about what keys to press or how to play the game.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4.2</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 7:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>They should include an instruction key on how to play their game. Other than that it is a great and innovative idea for a game, and I love the aesthetic.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 8:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>There is no indication of controls, so I am unable to play the game other than moving the cursor around.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 2.8</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 9:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Final Score: 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 10:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Final Score: 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 11:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Final Score: 4.6</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 12:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Final Score: 3.4</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Decisions Reached:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>AI implementation is needed for people who don&rsquo;t have a friend around to play with.</li>
      	<li>Some form of instructions for both controls and game mechanics is <em>still </em>desperately needed.</li>
      	<li>Art direction is still successful with players, we&rsquo;ve been doing a good job staying in line with it.</li>
      	<li>Some want audio to be added, if there&rsquo;s time it should be added.</li>
      	<li>Being able to undo movement and other things if a mistake is made should be implemented.</li>
      	<li>Game design and mechanics are still popular among those who understood them, they should remain as is.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Other External Playtests &ndash;</h2>
      <p>Respondent 1:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>"Field manual doesn't work. I like it but going back to the main menu quits the entire game and had me restart the match."</li>
      	<li>"I think it&rsquo;s better with [only being able to move a certain number of units at a time]. Only move a certain amount for a few characters."</li>
      	<li>Final Score: N/A</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 2:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>"The game is still a work in progress. I did not know the rules of the game but figured it out. You can win by capturing the enemy capital or by killing all their units. I tried to check the field guide for information, but it turned up blank. I could not use the L key to back out of it and had to reload the page. The quit button also caused a similar issue. The gameplay is straight forward. The units have limited movement and strengths based on their surroundings. The mechanic is quite clever, especially when the enemy secures a location like a city, bolstering their defenses. Some units have clear strengths over others, like the AT vs the Tank. Positioning your units for their specific matchups is a great strategic element. One potential bug I found was that regardless of whether a unit was moved and the turn was ended, its energy/gasoline still went down. I recommend adding a field manual for more clarity and music/sound for more enjoyability. The game has good strategic components that make it like advanced chess. Another interesting concept would be if the units had different ranges, for instance, the tank could shoot furthest but would have the least mobility."</li>
      	<li>Final Score: N/A</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 3:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Aesthetic is excellent, but I would suggest mirroring the unit health overlay on the red units to make the game look even more polished. The low ammo, low fuel, out of ammo, and out of fuel icons on units are unclear and unintuitive.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4.75</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 4:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>The game really needs a way to undo things, it doesn&rsquo;t feel very playable without it. Also, if you put a unit in a headquarters, it&rsquo;s possible to be sieged by 3 enemies and still win. The game is good but needs some balancing and additions.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 5:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Consider changing the select and back buttons from E and F to K and L. E and F make it so you have to play the game with one hand, which slows down the gameplay.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 6:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Whole game looks very professional, well done!</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 7:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>The field manual is pretty clear and is a good way to teach new players the game. The main menu is also very good, I like the units in still scenes on the different menus.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4.5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 8:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>The different maps are well designed and are a good variety, great work!</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 4</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 9:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>The field manual is useful for learning the game, but I&rsquo;m still not fully familiar with it. I don&rsquo;t like that I have to exit a map and lose all progress to reference the manual in-game. Consider making the field manual accessible in a match.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 3.5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 10:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>I really enjoyed our match! The game is great the way it is, but maybe in the future you could add more units like engineers that can build on the map, or medics, maybe super powerful units?</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 11:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Visuals and gameplay are great. I don&rsquo;t mind that there isn&rsquo;t any audio, I don&rsquo;t care much for it, and would probably mute it anyways.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Respondent 12:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Wow, the addition of the main menu really brought the game together! It&rsquo;s cool to see how far the game&rsquo;s come since the beginning.</li>
      	<li>Final Score: 5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Decisions Reached:</p>
      <ul>
      	<li>As noted by respondents 1 and 2, the field manual needed to be added.</li>
      	<li>Some consider it a bug that units consume fuel when not moving. This was intentional, but we will look at how the game flows when this is not the case.</li>
      	<li>Once the field manual was added, it was successful, but players complained that they had to exit a match to read it. We will consider adding a way to view it during a match.</li>
      	<li>Respondent 3 makes a good point about mirroring the red player&rsquo;s unit overlay, it will be done.</li>
      	<li>Respondent 5&rsquo;s control scheme swap suggestion is good, and we will change the controls to K and L.</li>
      	<li>Some were indifferent to the lack of sound; others really want it. Sound should be added but mutable.</li>
      	<li>Some proposed new features, but due to time constraints and scope, these will likely not be added.</li>
      </ul>
